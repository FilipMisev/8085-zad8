# 8085-zad8
A multi-processor system consists of 4µP 8085A. One of them is superior to the other three. The parent µP sends a data byte to all subsequent µPs they process it. The superior µP after sending the the data enters IDLE mode and remains for 3.2 msec. Then it polls the result of all 3 µP and compares it. If all 3 results are the same, it lights up green, if they are a different red light is on.
